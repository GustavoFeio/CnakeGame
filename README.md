*Disclaimer*: This was developed fully in a Linux environment. Do not expect it to work on other platforms.

# Dependencies
This project depends on [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), so you need to clone the repository recursively:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GustavoFeio/CnakeGame.git
```

The project is built with Makefile.

# Building
Go to the project root directory and run:
```sh
$ make
```

You should now have the executable `cnake_game`:
```sh
$ ./cnake_game
```
Have fun!

# Cleaning
To clean all files generated simply run:
```sh
make clean
```
This will also remove files generated by submodules.

# Controls
- `w` `a` `s` `d`/`arrow keys` to move the snake
- `Space` to restart if the game is over
- `Escape` to pause/unpause the game
